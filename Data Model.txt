Introduction: 
Flight delay is inevitable, and it plays an important role in both profits and loss of the airlines. An accurate estimation of flight delay is critical for airlines because the results can be applied to increase customer satisfaction and incomes of airline agencies. Assuming $47 per hour* as the average value of a passenger’s time, flight delays are estimated to have cost air travelers billions of dollars. FAA/Nextor estimated the annual costs of delays (direct cost to airlines and passengers, lost demand, and indirect costs) in 2018 to be $28 billion.[1]
The delay occurrence can stem from various factors such as Air Carrier Delay(6.57%), Aircraft Arriving Late (5.34%), National Aviation System Delay (4.12%), Canceled (1.72%), “Extreme” Weather (.74%).[2]

Problem statement:
Our project is about flight delays caused by inclement weather in May 2019. We have covered all the airports in the US. The data gathered is limited to just one month. But we hope that it will give us a great direction on how weather plays a part in flight delays. In this project, the goal is to use exploratory analysis and to build machine learning models to predict airline departure and arrival delays.

Data Gathering: 
1.	Historical Flight Delay and Weather Data USA:
The historical flight dataset is provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics and can be found at: https://www.bts.gov/browse-statistical-products-and-data/bts-publications/airline-service-quality-performance-234-time Weather data was downloaded from the Local Climatological Data provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/datatools/lcd For each airport in the flight dataset, the geographically nearest weather station is considered.[3]

2.	Airports in the United States of America:
List of airports in the United States of America, with latitude and longitude. Unverified community data. [4]

Delay time:
A flight is on-time if the departure delay is within 15-min of the scheduled departure time (CRSDepTime). A flight is delayed if the departure delay is more than 15-min late from the scheduled departure time (CRSDepTime). 

Data Model and Analysis:

1.	Which model did you choose and why?

We will implement a machine learning model in Python. You will use Scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library. We will use supervised Machine learning to perform tasks such as learning from data patterns and making predictions. Supervised Learning will help to predict, based on the airport location and the weather conditions whether a flight will be delayed or not. 

2.	How are you training your model?
The two main uses of supervised learning: regression and classification. In the first part of the project, we look at using Python based Logistic Regression along with Support Vector Machine and then plugging the dataset into our classifier for results. 
Logistic regression was chosen to model flight delay for multiple reasons. First, the weights of each feature trained by logistic regression are easily interpretable, as the sign of the weight indicates if a flight is more or less likely to be delayed if it has a high value for that feature. Second, logistic regression outputs a measure of confidence in its output through the probability of belonging to each class.

3.	What is the model's accuracy?
It's not enough to use a machine learning model to create predictions. The model will answer an important question: how well does it perform? Accuracy score is one way of assessing a classification model's performance. That is, what percentage of predictions does it get right.

4.	How does this model work?
The purpose of this project is to look at the approaches used to build models for predicting flight delays that occur due to bad weather conditions. 
Logistic regression: It will evaluate the probability of an occurrence. 
Support vector machine (SVM): It is a binary classifier: It will categorize samples into one of two categories (for example, yes or no).
