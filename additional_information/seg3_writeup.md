## Segment 3: X Role

For this segment, I tested another Machine Learning Model -Random Forest. 

Logistic regression performs better when the number of noise variables is less than or equal to the number of explanatory variables and random forest has a higher true and false positive rate as the number of explanatory variables increases in a dataset.

Below is the score comparison of Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
