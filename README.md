# To_fly_or_not_to_fly

## Purpose
This README will serve as a project/presentation outline as we work.

## The Story
Delayed or cancelled flights can ruin business trips, vacations, family events, and so much more. But what if you could predict whether or not a flight will be cancelled before you even arrive at the airport? You could change your plans, find another way to get to your destination, call in on Zoom. The possibilities are endless.

We wanted to make this a reality, so we decided to take a look at flights that have been cancelled due to weather in order to determine the likelihood of a flight being cancelled based on specific combinations of weather events.
